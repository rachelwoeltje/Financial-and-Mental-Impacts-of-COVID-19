## Executive Summary
COVID-19 was a natural occurrence that affected the entire world. It was the first time we saw the world shutdown, and everything come to a pause. Although this was necessary to cease the spread of the pandemic, this had a large impact on mental health, the economy, and how we live our everyday lives. It was an adjustment for everyone to learn this new way of living and discover how we could overcome this pandemic together. Using data that covers the trends before and after the pandemic, I intend to show how COVID-19 affected people’s daily lives, their spending habits, and determining why the economy dropped and suddenly recovered. 

My assumptions going into this project were that there would be a correlation in job loss along with an increase in mental health. In relation to my findings, this assumption was correct.

## Motivation
The world must function a certain way to maintain consistency. COVID-19 changed numerous aspects including people working from home, businesses shutting down, and the effects on people’s health both mentally and physically. There has rarely ever been a situation like this where the entire world, with billions of people, was affected at once. As one of these people in the masses who have been impacted by this rare occasion, I wanted to dive deeper into the affects and aftermath this impact has had on society. Most of the time, issues may arise that affect a country or state, but this is an occurrence where it has impacted the entire world. We saw the world go radio silent for an entire year. I want to determine the mental, cultural, and financial repercussions it had on the economy.

## Findings:
Financial and Mental Impacts of COVID-19

The higher the rate of job loss, depression levels will increase as well.

Consumer Behavior became very protective in each generation.

The Northwestern states had the least amount of depression rates. This was interesting and probably a low amount because they are not high traffic and citified areas. However, places such as California, Texas, and New York had high amounts of depression.

## Key Takeaways:
It is important to focus on attention to the rising depression level. Although the unemployment rate has decreased, mental health should not be taken lightly. Furthermore, people should use their experience with the pandemic to set a budget to ensure they will have future savings if another event were to occur like this again.
